Predicting whether a tweet would be viral, or where the user is from using machine learning


viral_tweets takes the five user determined features of the data set and uses KNeighborsClassifier to determine which one has the greatest influence on whether a tweet goes viral or not. 

tweet_location uses Naive Bayers to give a prediction for which city the tweet likely came from. I used a famous Hardy Bucks quote, to which the file predicted it came from New York
